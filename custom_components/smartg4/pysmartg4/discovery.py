"""Bus device discovery.

Active: broadcast ReadMACAddress (0xF003) to 255.255 — every module
answers 0xF004 with its MAC and remark (user-assigned name), and the
frame header carries its subnet/device/type.

Passive: while listening, record the header of every telegram seen, so
even devices that ignore 0xF003 show up once they broadcast anything
(sensors, panels and scene modules chat regularly).

    Broadcast scan responses are very lossy: when every module answers at
    once, the RS-485 side collides and the gateway relays only a random
    subset (observed ~10 of ~38 per probe). So we keep probing for the
    whole window and accumulate the union — the official SDK likewise
    repeats every send 3x at 300 ms for this reason. `probes` limits the
    number of probe rounds; by default rounds continue until `duration`
